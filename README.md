# clj-seh-challenge

## LPG Implementation

There are 2 implementations:

1. `LPG:Scratch` : my homemade implementation of a labelled property graph
2. `LPG:Loom` : with the same API, but uses Loom (https://github.com/aysylu/loom) as the graph mechanism under the hood.  Used for validation and testing.

They both implement protocol `LPG`.

All of this is in the `lpg.clj` file.

## Run Tests

I wrote a lot of code using test-driven development.  I wrote most of the tests to take either impl of `LPG` to check my implementation against 
a "more correct" version using Loom.

In repl:
``` 
(run-tests 'clj-seh-challenge.core-test)
```
or in terminal:
``` 
lein test 
```

output:
```

Simple Test Took  clj_seh_challenge.lpg.LPG:Loom  :  0.014  s
Perf Test Took  clj_seh_challenge.lpg.LPG:Loom  :  0.246  s

Ran 2 tests containing 31 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
```

- `Simple Test` : a simple scenario.  tests both implementations
- `Perf Test`: a test with slightly more data, to compare the impls.  tests both implementations
- `Serialize Test`: tests only `LPG:Scratch`, testing the to and from JSON functionality
- `Slurp Serialize Test`: tests only `LPG:Scratch`, testing from an existing JSON file in this repo, `test-lpg.json`


See the test namespace for more documentation about the tests.

## TODO
Here's what I think might be missing. A lot of these can be done outside lib using existing methods,
but a better version of this library would probably include these:

- [x] BF traverse method 
- [ ] DF traverse method
- [ ] labels for nodes.  it was a design decision to omit node labels in this impl, a better version might include this
- [ ] subgraph method
- [ ] path method
- [ ] method to return all nodes reachable from a provided node
- [ ] a hook to visualize (loom has a method that uses graphviz, my impl would need to use that or something from scratch)
- [ ] delete nodes/edges
